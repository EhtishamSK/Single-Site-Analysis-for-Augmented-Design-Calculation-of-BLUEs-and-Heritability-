This R script performs analysis using the asreml package for estimating Best Linear Unbiased Estimates (BLUEs) and heritability of multiple traits in a dataset. It processes data for genotypes, blocks, rows, and columns, recoding controls and calculating key model parameters. The script includes both single-trait and multi-trait analyses, with separate models for handling row and column effects. It calculates heritability, predicts BLUEs for both test and check genotypes, and generates CSV outputs for the results, including heritability estimates and predictions for various traits.
